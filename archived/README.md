# Archived Files

This folder contains the original working implementation files that were used during development. These files have been superseded by the reference implementations in `reference-backend/` and `reference-frontend/`.

## Contents

- **backend/** - Original backend implementation (working demo)
- **frontend/** - Original frontend implementation (working demo)
- **start-confidential.sh** - Start script for confidential client implementation
- **start.sh** - Start script for device code flow implementation

## Why Archived?

These files were the initial working implementations. They have been replaced by the reference implementations which:
- Include extensive documentation and comments
- Are better organized for educational purposes
- Serve as both working code and documentation
- Follow consistent naming conventions

## Should You Use These Files?

**No** - Use the reference implementations instead:
- `reference-backend/` - Well-documented backend implementation
- `reference-frontend/` - Well-documented frontend implementation

These archived files are kept for historical reference only.
